# Task Manager App

This app is a simple 'To Do' task manager build with Ruby On Rails.

It includes basic CRUD features:

- As a user, I can list tasks
- As a user, I can view the details of a task
- As a user, I can add a new task
- As a user, I can edit a task (mark as completed / update title & details)
- As a user, I can remove a task

Done during my time at Le Wagon.
